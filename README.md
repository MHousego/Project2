# Project2

Uploaded is sample code i pulled from the api github. i was using it to attempt a general tweet search but looks like this functions to get data from specific tweets you already have the ID for. Still, the search was successful and i was able to pull in tweet info to python. 

Nlp_test is example code provided by google where i was able to test the sentiment of a string input to the code. next step is to combine both apis with my user case....
